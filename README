Hello

SEE (or see, whatever) is a simple search engine written in Erlang. So
far it can crawl through web indexing new pages into ets table.

Example session
---------------

Initializing search engine:

> application:start(inets).
> application:start(see).

Adding first URL to queue:

> see_db:queue("www.yahoo.com").

Adding a crawler:

> see_crawler_sup:add().

or 

> see_crawler_sup:add(1).

Now the crawler searches the web. Searching so far indexed pages:

> see_db:search(["USA", "Obama"]).

It'll search pages, where both "USA" and "Obama" appears, and returns a list
of them in an order from highest number of occurrences to lowest.
