Hello

SEE (or see, whatever) is a simple search engine written in Erlang. So
far it can crawl through web indexing new pages into Mnesia database.

It uses OTP supervisor to create web crawlers as workers. Before that
the database must be initialized.

Example session
---------------

Initializing search engine:

> application:start(db).
> application:start(crawler).

Adding first URL to queue:

> db:queue("www.yahoo.com").

Adding a crawler:

> crawler_sup:add().

or 

> crawler_sup:add(1).

Searching indexed pages:

> db:search(["USA", "Obama"]).

It'll search pages, where both "USA" and "Obama" appears, and returns a list
of them in an order from highest number of occurrences to lowest.
